### ObjectiveCDM: A Dead Simple Download Manager

ObjectiveCDM is a files download manager built on top of NSURLSession for iOS. It supports auto resume on internet connection recovery.

Choose ObjectiveCDM for your next project as your download manager!

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries 

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "ObjectiveCDM", "~> 1.0.6"
```

### Change Log for 1.0.6

- Some small bug fixes
- Change destination on ObjectiveCDownloadTask to store relative path instead of absolute path like in previous version 

### Features

- Ability to download a batch of files.
- Checksum (MD5, SHA1, SHA512) / File Size is verified once a file has been downloaded. Auto redownload file if Checksum / File Size is mismatched.
- Auto resume on internet connection recovery.
- Overall Progress & individual download progress
- Downloading Rate Computation
- Remaining Time Computation

### Usage

#### ObjectiveCDM
`ObjectiveCDM` can perform download on a batch of URL strings or `NSURL` objects.

- Only URL and Destination are compulsory in each of the dowloading information. `url` can be string or `NSURL` object
- If `fileSize` is not supplied, the download manager will trigger a `HEAD` request to query for content length to fill in `fileSize`.
- If checksum is supplied, the download manager will verify againsts the downloaded file's checksum. If no checksum is supplied, the verification will be only based on the `fileSize`. Default file hashing algorithm is SHA1. You can change by using

```objective-c
ObjectiveCDM* objectiveCDM = [ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance];
objectiveCDM.fileHashAlgorithm = FileHashAlgorithmMD5;
```

- If the final verification on downloaded file is failed, the file will be queued to be downloaded again.

```objective-c
#import "ObjectiveCDM.h"

[objectiveCDM downloadBatch:@[
    @{
        @"url": @"http://87.76.16.10/test10.zip",
        @"destination": @"test/test10.zip",
        @"fileSize": [NSNumber numberWithLongLong:11536384],
        @"checksum": @"5e8bbbb38d137432ce0c8029da83e52e635c7a4f",
        @"identifier": @"Content-1001"
    },
    @{
        @"url": @"http://speedtest.dal01.softlayer.com/downloads/test100.zip",
        @"destination": @"test/test100.zip",
        @"fileSize": [NSNumber numberWithLongLong:104874307],
        @"checksum": @"592b849861f8d5d9d75bda5d739421d88e264900",
        @"identifier": @"Content-1002"
    }
]];
  
```

- Alternatively, you can add a batch to `objectiveCDM` instance first and then call `startDownloadingCurrentBatch` later

```objective-c
[objectiveCDM addBatch:@[
    ...
]];

...

[objectiveCDM startDownloadingCurrentBatch];
```

- You can set initial downloaded bytes - this will help to calculate the overall progress if you have already have some downloaded files from last download

```objective-c
ObjectiveCDM* objectiveCDM = [ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance];
[objectiveCDM setInitialDownloadedBytes:1024];
```

- You can set total bytes for helping to calculate the overall progress. This total byte will override the calculation of the actual total bytes to be received of each download.

```objective-c
ObjectiveCDM* objectiveCDM = [ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance];
[objectiveCDM setTotalBytes:1048576];
```

- By default, the checksum algorithm to verify the downloaded file is SHA1. You can change this by using

``` objective-c
ObjectiveCDM* objectiveCDM = [ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance];
objectiveCDM.fileHashAlgorithm = FileHashAlgorithmMD5;
// objectiveCDM.fileHashAlgorithm = FileHashAlgorithmSHA512;
// objectiveCDM.fileHashAlgorithm = FileHashAlgorithmSHA1; // default
```

#### ObjectiveCDMUIDelegate

`ObjectiveCDMUIDelegate` can be used to update progress of the batch download and update finish status of the whole batch

```objective-c
// ObjectiveCDM* objectiveCDM = [ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance];
// objectiveCDM.uiDelegate = self;
// ...
- (void) didReachProgress:(float)progress {
  // this method is run on main thread
  // ... update progress bar or progress text here
}

- (void) didFinishAll {
  // this method is run on main thread
  // ... update completed status of the whole batch
}

- (void) didFinishOnDownloadTaskUI:(ObjectiveCDMDownloadTask*) task {
  // this method is run on main thread
  // ... update completed status of a download task 
}

- (void) didReachIndividualProgress:(float)progress onDownloadTask:(ObjectiveCDMDownloadTask*) task {
  // this method is run on main thread
  // ... update progress of a task
}
```

#### ObjectiveCDMDataDelegate

`ObjectiveCDMDataDelegate` can be used to process file after finish downloading

```objective-c
// ObjectiveCDM* objectiveCDM = [ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance];
// objectiveCDM.dataDelegate = self;
// ...
- (void) didFinishDownloadObject:(ObjectiveCDMDownloadTask *)downloadTaskInfo {
  // this method is run on background thread
  // finish a task with ObjectiveCDMDownloadTask downloadInfo
}

- (void) didFinishAllForDataDelegate {
  // this method is run on background thread
  // do whatever needs to be done after a batch has been downloaded successfully
}


```

#### ObjectiveCDMDownloadTask

In `didFinishDownloadObject` you will receive an `ObjectiveCDMDownloadTask` instance. Inside this instance, you will be able to retrieve the following attributes

```objective-c
NSURL *url = downloadTaskInfo.url;
NSString *urlString = downloadTaskInfo.urlString;
NSString *destination = downloadTaskInfo.destination; // destination is the full path to the downloaded file
NSString *fileName = downloadTaskInfo.fileName;
NSString *checksum = downloadTaskInfo.checksum;
NSString *identifier = downloadTaskInfo.identifier;
```

### Additional Functionality

- You can add a download task to current batch:

```objective-c
[[ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance] addDownloadTask:@{@"url": @"http://download.thinkbroadband.com/5MB.zip", @"destination": @"test/5MB.zip"}];
```

- You can get out the current list of downloading tasks

```objective-c
NSArray *currentDownloadTask = [[ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance] downloadingTasks];
```

- To get the downloading rate and remaining time:

```objective-c
NSArray* downloadRateAndRemaining = [[ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance] downloadRateAndRemainingTime];
NSString *downloadRate = downloadRateAndRemaining[0];
NSString *remainingTime = downloadRateAndRemaining[1];
```

- To check if the download manager is downloading:

```objective-c
BOOL isDownloading = [[ObjectiveCDM sharedInstance] isDownloading];
```

### Running Example

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jameshuynh/ObjectiveCDM.git
```

- Double click on `ObjectiveCDM-Example/ObjectiveCDM-Example.xcworkspace`
- `Cmd + R` to run the example project :-)

### Contribution

Contribution, Suggestion and Issues are very much appreciated :). Please also fork and send your pull request!

### Roadmap to version 2.0

- Transfer Rate (KB/s, MB/s)
- Elapsed Downloading Time
- Auto Test Coverage
- Split download (i.e. download 1 file using many threads) to speed up download
